# Week 5: ROS 2 Navigation and Perception

## Overview

Week 5 explores the ROS 2 navigation and perception pipelines that enable robots to understand their environment and navigate autonomously. You'll learn about SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), navigation stacks, sensor processing, and the integration of perception systems with robot control. This week builds on the URDF and tool knowledge from Week 4 to create complete perception and navigation systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Implement SLAM systems for mapping and localization
- Configure and use ROS 2 navigation stacks
- Process sensor data for environment perception
- Integrate perception and navigation with robot control systems

## Schedule

This week consists of five chapters, each focusing on different aspects of navigation and perception:

1. [SLAM and Mapping](./5-1-slam-mapping.md) - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping techniques
2. [Navigation Stacks](./5-2-navigation-stacks.md) - ROS 2 navigation system configuration
3. [Perception Pipelines](./5-3-perception-pipelines.md) - Processing sensor data for understanding
4. [Sensor Fusion](./5-4-sensor-fusion.md) - Combining data from multiple sensors
5. [Week 5 Conclusion](./5-5-week-5-conclusion.md) - Summary and next steps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Completed Week 1-4 (Introduction through ROS 2 Tools)
- Understanding of robot modeling with URDF
- Knowledge of ROS 2 communication patterns
- Experience with sensor integration
- Basic understanding of coordinate transformations

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 15-18 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- SLAM implementation with LiDAR data
- Navigation stack configuration for a robot platform
- Perception pipeline for object detection
- Sensor fusion implementation combining multiple sensor types

## Resources

- Navigation2 tutorials and examples
- Perception pipeline documentation
- SLAM algorithm implementations
- Sensor fusion best practices

## Next Week Preview

In Week 6, we'll explore control systems and motion planning, including PID controllers, trajectory generation, and whole-body control.
