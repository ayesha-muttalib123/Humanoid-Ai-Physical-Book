# Week 8: AI Integration in Physical Systems

## Overview

Week 8 explores the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, focusing on how AI algorithms can be effectively applied to robotic platforms for perception, decision-making, and control. You'll learn about machine learning for robotics, computer vision, natural language processing for human-robot interaction, and how to deploy AI models on embedded platforms. This week bridges the gap between abstract AI concepts and their practical application in embodied systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Integrate AI models with robotic perception systems
- Apply computer vision techniques to robot perception
- Implement natural language interfaces for robot control
- Deploy AI models on embedded robotics platforms
- Understand the constraints and requirements of AI in physical systems

## Schedule

This week consists of five chapters, each focusing on different aspects of AI integration:

1. [Machine Learning for Robotics](./8-1-machine-learning-robotics.md) - AI algorithms applied to robotics problems
2. [Computer Vision in Physical AI](./8-2-computer-vision-physical-ai.md) - Vision processing for embodied systems
3. [Natural Language for Human-Robot Interaction](./8-3-natural-language-hri.md) - NLP for robot communication
4. [AI Model Deployment](./8-4-ai-model-deployment.md) - Deploying models on embedded platforms
5. [Week 8 Conclusion](./8-5-week-8-conclusion.md) - Summary and next steps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Completed Week 1-7 (Introduction through Simulation and Testing)
- Understanding of robot control and perception systems
- Knowledge of ROS 2 communication patterns
- Experience with simulation environments and testing

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 15-18 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Implement a machine learning model for robot navigation
- Create a computer vision pipeline for object detection on a robot
- Develop a natural language interface for robot commands
- Deploy an AI model on an embedded platform with performance evaluation

## Resources

- AI/ML libraries for robotics (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV)
- ROS 2 AI integration tools and packages
- Pre-trained models suitable for robotics applications
- Hardware acceleration resources (CUDA, TensorRT, etc.)

## Next Week Preview

In Week 9, we'll explore advanced topics in Physical AI including swarm robotics, collaborative AI systems, and ethical considerations for embodied AI.
