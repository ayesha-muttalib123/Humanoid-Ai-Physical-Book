# Week 3: Robot Hardware Fundamentals

## Overview

Week 3 focuses on the essential hardware components that enable robots to interact with the physical world. You'll learn about different types of actuators and sensors, computing platforms suitable for robotics applications, and power systems that enable autonomous operation. Understanding these hardware fundamentals is crucial for designing effective Physical AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Identify and classify different types of robot actuators and their applications
- Understand various sensor technologies and their characteristics
- Evaluate computing platforms for robotics applications
- Design power systems for robotic applications

## Schedule

This week consists of five chapters, each focusing on different aspects of robot hardware:

1. [Actuators and Motor Control](./3-1-actuators-motor-control.md) - Understanding motors and actuation systems
2. [Sensor Technologies (LiDAR, Cameras, IMU)](./3-2-sensor-technologies.md) - Different types of sensors and their applications
3. [Computing Platforms (Jetson Orin Nano Super $249)](./3-3-computing-platforms.md) - Computing solutions for robotics
4. [Power Systems and Management](./3-4-power-systems.md) - Power considerations for robotic systems
5. [Hardware Integration Patterns](./3-5-hardware-integration.md) - Integration patterns for hardware systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Completed Week 1 (Introduction to Physical AI)
- Basic understanding of electronics and circuits
- Understanding of fundamental physics principles

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 12-15 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.
