# 1.4 Humanoid Robotics Landscape

## Introduction

Humanoid robotics represents one of the most challenging and ambitious domains in Physical AI. Humanoid robots are designed with human-like form factors, typically featuring a head, torso, two arms, and two legs. This design choice stems from the belief that human-like robots can better interact with human environments and potentially offer insights into human intelligence and behavior.

The field encompasses a wide range of applications, from research platforms to commercial products, each with different capabilities, limitations, and development challenges.
