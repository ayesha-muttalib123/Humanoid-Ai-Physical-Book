# Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI

## Overview

Module 1 introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. This module establishes the theoretical basis for understanding how artificial intelligence systems can be designed to operate effectively in physical environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Define embodied intelligence and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches
- Explain the role of sensorimotor integration in intelligent behavior
- Understand the principles of embodied cognition
- Identify the advantages of physically-grounded AI systems
- Recognize scenarios where embodied AI approaches are superior to traditional methods

## Topics Covered

This module covers the following topics:

1. [Foundations of Physical AI](./foundations-physical-ai.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Embodied Cognition](./embodied-cognition.md) - Theoretical foundations of embodied intelligence
3. [Sensorimotor Integration](./sensorimotor-integration.md) - How perception and action are interconnected

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- Familiarity with fundamental mathematics and physics
- Programming background (Python preferred)

## Estimated Time

This module requires approximately 10-12 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assessment

Module 1 includes:
- Reading comprehension questions
- Conceptual analysis exercises
- Small practical exercises applying foundational concepts

## Next Steps

After completing this module, students will be prepared to explore the hardware and software foundations of Physical AI in subsequent modules. The concepts learned here will be essential for understanding how AI systems can be effectively integrated with physical systems.
