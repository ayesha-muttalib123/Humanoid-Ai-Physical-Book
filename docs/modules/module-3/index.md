# Module 3: Software Frameworks

## Overview

Module 3 explores the software frameworks and tools that enable the development of Physical AI systems. This module covers the key software platforms including ROS 2, perception algorithms, planning and control systems that bridge the gap between high-level AI and low-level hardware control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Install, configure, and use ROS 2 for robotic applications
- Implement perception algorithms for processing sensor data
- Design planning and control systems for robot navigation and manipulation
- Integrate perception, planning, and control into cohesive systems
- Understand the architecture and best practices of modern robotics software

## Topics Covered

This module covers the following topics:

1. [ROS 2 Introduction](./ros2-introduction.md) - Core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
2. [Perception Algorithms](./perception-algorithms.md) - Processing sensor data for environmental understanding
3. [Planning and Control](./planning-control.md) - Navigating and acting in physical environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Completed Module 1 (Foundations) and Module 2 (Hardware Systems)
- Basic programming skills in Python or C++
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts

## Estimated Time

This module requires approximately 15-18 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assessment

Module 3 includes:
- ROS 2 node development exercises
- Perception pipeline implementation tasks
- Control system design and testing
- Integration challenges combining perception and control

## Next Steps

After completing this module, students will have the software foundation needed to integrate their hardware knowledge from Module 2. The combined understanding of hardware and software will be essential for the system integration work in Module 4.
