# Week 13: Conversational Robotics and Capstone

## Overview

Welcome to Week 13 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This final week explores conversational robotics and capstone projects, integrating GPT models, speech processing, and multi-modal interfaces. You'll learn how to create sophisticated interaction systems that combine language, vision, and action to complete your journey through Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Integrate GPT and large language models with humanoid robots
- Implement speech processing and recognition systems
- Design multi-modal interaction interfaces
- Synthesize knowledge through capstone project completion

## Schedule

This week consists of four chapters, each designed to build upon the previous one:

1. [GPT Integration](./13-1-gpt-integration.md) - Integrating large language models
2. [Speech Processing](./13-2-speech-processing.md) - Speech recognition and generation
3. [Multi-Modal Integration](./13-3-multi-modal-integration.md) - Combining sensory modalities
4. [Capstone Overview](./13-4-capstone-overview.md) - Capstone project synthesis

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Knowledge of speech recognition and synthesis
- Experience with multi-modal systems
- Completion of all previous course material

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 8-10 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Integration of a language model with a robot simulator
- Implementation of speech processing pipeline
- Design of multi-modal interaction system
- Completion of capstone project proposal

## Resources

- Recommended readings from the course bibliography
- Links to relevant research papers and articles
- Video lectures and demonstrations (if available)

## Course Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! You now have a comprehensive understanding of embodied artificial intelligence, from fundamental concepts to advanced integration techniques. This knowledge provides a solid foundation for further exploration in robotics and AI.
