# Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview

Welcome to Week 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This week introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. You'll learn about the foundations that differentiate Physical AI from traditional approaches, explore the principles of embodied intelligence, and understand how physical laws govern the interaction between AI systems and the real world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches
- Explain the principles of embodied intelligence and its importance
- Understand the relationship between digital AI and physical laws
- Describe the landscape of humanoid robotics and its applications

## Schedule

This week consists of four chapters, each designed to build upon the previous one:

1. [Foundations of Physical AI](./1-1-foundations-physical-ai.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Embodied Intelligence Principles](./1-2-embodied-intelligence-principles.md) - Theoretical foundations
3. [From Digital AI to Physical Laws](./1-3-digital-ai-physical-laws.md) - Bridging the gap between digital and physical
4. [Humanoid Robotics Landscape](./1-4-humanoid-robotics-landscape.md) - Overview of humanoid robotics applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics
- Familiarity with basic concepts of robotics or AI (optional but helpful)

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 8-10 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Reading comprehension quiz covering Week 1 concepts
- Simple analysis exercise comparing traditional AI with Physical AI approaches
- Research assignment on a humanoid robot platform of your choice

## Resources

- Recommended readings from the course bibliography
- Links to relevant research papers and articles
- Video lectures and demonstrations (if available)

## Next Week Preview

In Week 2, we'll dive into robot hardware fundamentals, exploring sensors and actuators that enable physical interaction with the environment.
