# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive 13-week curriculum bridges digital AI to embodied intelligence, covering everything from foundational concepts to advanced humanoid development.

## About This Course

This course teaches the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, emphasizing the importance of sensorimotor experience in creating truly intelligent agents. Students will learn how physical embodiment shapes intelligence and why this approach is crucial for developing general AI systems.

The curriculum covers:
- Embodied Intelligence principles
- Hardware fundamentals and platforms
- ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac
- Humanoid kinematics, locomotion, manipulation
- Capstone project integrating GPT, speech, and multi-modal capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Introductory robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command line tools

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/physical-ai-course.git
   cd physical-ai-course
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
