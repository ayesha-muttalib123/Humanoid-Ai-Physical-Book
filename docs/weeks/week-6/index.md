# Week 6: Control Systems and Motion Planning

## Overview

Week 6 focuses on the control systems and motion planning algorithms that enable robots to execute precise movements and achieve desired behaviors. You'll learn about PID controllers, advanced control algorithms, trajectory generation, and motion planning techniques that allow robots to navigate and manipulate objects effectively. This week bridges the gap between perception/understanding and physical action.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Implement PID and advanced control algorithms for robotic systems
- Generate and execute trajectories for robot motion
- Apply motion planning algorithms for obstacle avoidance and path optimization
- Integrate control systems with perception and navigation systems

## Schedule

This week consists of five chapters, each focusing on different aspects of control and motion planning:

1. [PID Controllers and Control Theory](./6-1-pid-control-theory.md) - Fundamental control algorithms
2. [Trajectory Generation and Execution](./6-2-trajectory-generation-execution.md) - Planning and executing robot motion
3. [Motion Planning Algorithms](./6-3-motion-planning-algorithms.md) - Path planning and obstacle avoidance
4. [Whole-Body Control](./6-4-whole-body-control.md) - Coordinated control of entire robot bodies
5. [Week 6 Conclusion](./6-5-week-6-conclusion.md) - Summary and next steps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Completed Week 1-5 (Introduction through Navigation and Perception)
- Understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics
- Knowledge of coordinate transformations and frames
- Experience with sensor integration and state estimation

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 15-18 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- PID controller implementation and tuning for a simulated robot
- Trajectory generation for complex robot movements
- Motion planning implementation with obstacle avoidance
- Whole-body control for a multi-DOF robotic arm

## Resources

- Control theory textbooks and references
- ROS 2 control and trajectory tutorials
- Motion planning algorithm implementations
- Control system simulation environments

## Next Week Preview

In Week 7, we'll explore simulation environments and testing methodologies, including Gazebo, Webots, and Isaac Sim, as well as testing strategies for Physical AI systems.
