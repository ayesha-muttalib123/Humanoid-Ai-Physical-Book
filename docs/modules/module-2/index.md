# Module 2: Hardware Systems

## Overview

Module 2 focuses on the hardware foundations of Physical AI systems. This module covers the physical components that enable AI systems to interact with the real world, including robot platforms, sensors, actuators, and real-time control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Identify different types of robot platforms and their appropriate applications
- Understand the characteristics and capabilities of various sensors and actuators
- Design real-time control systems for physical AI applications
- Integrate hardware components effectively with software systems
- Evaluate trade-offs between different hardware configurations

## Topics Covered

This module covers the following topics:

1. [Robot Platforms](./robot-platforms.md) - Different types of robot platforms and their capabilities
2. [Sensors and Actuators](./sensors-actuators.md) - Understanding perception and action components
3. [Real-Time Control Systems](./real-time-control.md) - Designing systems for real-time physical interaction

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Completed Module 1 (Foundations of Physical AI)
- Basic understanding of electronics and mechanics
- Understanding of fundamental physics principles

## Estimated Time

This module requires approximately 12-15 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assessment

Module 2 includes:
