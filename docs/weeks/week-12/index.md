# Week 12: Humanoid Development and Projects

## Overview

Welcome to Week 12 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This week focuses on humanoid development and projects, exploring advanced control systems, safety protocols, and project implementation strategies. You'll learn about sophisticated control algorithms, safety considerations, and best practices for implementing humanoid robot projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Design and implement advanced humanoid control systems
- Apply safety protocols and standards for humanoid robot operation
- Plan and execute humanoid robot projects effectively
- Refine and optimize humanoid robot implementations

## Schedule

This week consists of four chapters, each designed to build upon the previous one:

1. [Humanoid Control Systems](./12-1-humanoid-control-systems.md) - Advanced control strategies
2. [Humanoid Safety Protocols](./12-2-humanoid-safety-protocols.md) - Safety considerations
3. [Humanoid Project Implementation](./12-3-humanoid-project-implementation.md) - Implementation strategies
4. [Project Refinement](./12-4-project-refinement.md) - Optimization and refinement

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Understanding of control systems and feedback mechanisms
- Knowledge of safety engineering principles
- Experience with robotics project development
- Familiarity with risk assessment methodologies

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 8-10 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Design of a humanoid control system architecture
- Safety assessment for a humanoid robot platform
- Project implementation plan for a humanoid application
- Optimization analysis of humanoid robot performance

## Resources

- Recommended readings from the course bibliography
- Links to relevant research papers and articles
- Video lectures and demonstrations (if available)

## Next Week Preview

In Week 13, we'll explore conversational robotics and capstone projects, integrating GPT models, speech processing, and multi-modal interfaces to complete your journey through Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
