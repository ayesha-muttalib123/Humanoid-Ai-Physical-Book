# Week 4: URDF and ROS 2 Tools

## Overview

Week 4 focuses on advanced URDF modeling and the essential tools for ROS 2 development. You'll learn how to create detailed robot models with URDF, implement ROS 2 launch systems for managing complex robot deployments, configure parameter systems for runtime configuration, and explore the various tools that make ROS 2 development efficient and effective.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Create detailed and accurate URDF robot models
- Implement ROS 2 launch systems for complex robot deployments
- Configure and manage ROS 2 parameter systems
- Utilize ROS 2 tools for debugging, visualization, and system analysis

## Schedule

This week consists of five chapters, each focusing on different aspects of ROS 2 tools and URDF:

1. [URDF in Detail](./4-1-urdf-detailed.md) - Advanced URDF modeling techniques
2. [ROS 2 Launch System](./4-2-ros2-launch-system.md) - Managing complex robot deployments
3. [ROS 2 Parameter System](./4-3-ros2-parameter-system.md) - Runtime configuration management
4. [ROS 2 Tools](./4-4-ros2-tools.md) - Essential tools for ROS 2 development
5. [Week 4 Conclusion](./4-5-week-4-conclusion.md) - Summary and next steps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Completed Week 1-3 (Introduction, Hardware, and ROS 2 Architecture)
- Understanding of basic ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- Basic knowledge of XML for URDF
- Experience with command-line tools

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 12-15 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Detailed URDF model creation for a robot platform
- Launch file development for a multi-node robot system
- Parameter configuration for different robot operating modes
- Tool usage exercises for debugging and visualization

## Resources

- URDF tutorials and examples
- ROS 2 launch documentation
- Parameter management best practices
- Tool usage guides and cheat sheets

## Next Week Preview

In Week 5, we'll explore ROS 2 navigation and perception pipelines, including SLAM, navigation stacks, and sensor processing.
