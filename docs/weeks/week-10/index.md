# Week 10: Advanced RL and Planning

## Overview

Welcome to Week 10 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This week focuses on advanced reinforcement learning techniques and planning methodologies for robotics applications. You'll explore sophisticated RL algorithms, sim-to-real optimization techniques, current research directions in embodied AI, and best practices for robotics project planning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Understand advanced reinforcement learning techniques for robotics
- Apply sim-to-real optimization methods to transfer skills from simulation to reality
- Explore current research directions in embodied AI
- Plan and execute robotics projects effectively

## Schedule

This week consists of four chapters, each designed to build upon the previous one:

1. [Advanced RL Techniques](./10-1-advanced-rl-techniques.md) - Advanced algorithms and techniques
2. [Sim-to-Real Optimization](./10-2-sim-to-real-optimization.md) - Transfer learning from simulation
3. [Embodied AI Research](./10-3-embodied-ai-research.md) - Current research directions
4. [Project Planning](./10-4-project-planning.md) - Planning and execution strategies

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Understanding of basic reinforcement learning concepts
- Familiarity with robotics simulation environments
- Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals
- Experience with basic robotics algorithms

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 8-10 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Implementation exercise with advanced RL algorithms
- Sim-to-real transfer project planning
- Research paper analysis on embodied AI
- Project proposal for a robotics application

## Resources

- Recommended readings from the course bibliography
- Links to relevant research papers and articles
- Video lectures and demonstrations (if available)

## Next Week Preview

In Week 11, we'll explore humanoid kinematics and locomotion, diving into the mechanics of humanoid robot movement and control.
