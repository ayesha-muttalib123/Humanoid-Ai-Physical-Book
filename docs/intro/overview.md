# Course Overview: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This 13-week course provides a comprehensive introduction to the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems. You'll learn how to create AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world, bridging the gap between digital AI and embodied intelligence.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four main modules followed by weekly deep dives:

### Modules
1. **Foundations of Physical AI**: Theoretical concepts, sensorimotor integration, and embodied cognition
2. **Hardware Systems**: Robot platforms, sensors, actuators, and real-time control systems
3. **Software Frameworks**: ROS 2, perception, planning, and control algorithms
4. **Integration and Deployment**: System integration, testing, and real-world applications

### Weekly Curriculum
Each week focuses on a specific aspect of Physical AI and robotics, with practical examples, code snippets, and diagrams to enhance understanding:

- **Week 1**: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
- **Week 2**: Robot Hardware Fundamentals and Sensor Technologies
- **Weeks 3-5**: ROS 2 Architecture, Nodes, Packages, and URDF
- **Weeks 6-7**: Gazebo/Unity Simulation Environments
- **Weeks 8-10**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Perception, and Reinforcement Learning
- **Weeks 11-12**: Humanoid Development - Kinematics, Locomotion, and Manipulation
- **Week 13**: Conversational Robotics and Capstone Project

## Learning Approach

This course takes a hands-on approach to learning, with each concept reinforced through:

- **Rich MDX content**: Code blocks, diagrams, and interactive elements
- **Practical examples**: Real-world applications of each concept
