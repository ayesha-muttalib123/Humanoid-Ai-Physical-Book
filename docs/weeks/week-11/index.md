# Week 11: Humanoid Kinematics and Locomotion

## Overview

Welcome to Week 11 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This week focuses on humanoid kinematics and locomotion, exploring the mechanics of humanoid robot movement and control. You'll learn about forward and inverse kinematics, walking patterns, balance control, and manipulation techniques specific to humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Understand humanoid kinematics and forward/inverse kinematic solutions
- Analyze and control humanoid locomotion patterns
- Implement basic manipulation techniques for humanoid robots
- Design interaction strategies for humanoid-robot systems

## Schedule

This week consists of four chapters, each designed to build upon the previous one:

1. [Humanoid Kinematics](./11-1-humanoid-kinematics.md) - Kinematic analysis and modeling
2. [Humanoid Locomotion](./11-2-humanoid-locomotion.md) - Walking and movement control
3. [Humanoid Manipulation](./11-3-humanoid-manipulation.md) - Manipulation techniques
4. [Humanoid Interaction](./11-4-humanoid-interaction.md) - Human-robot interaction principles

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Understanding of basic kinematics concepts
- Knowledge of dynamics and control systems
- Experience with robotics simulation environments
- Familiarity with coordinate transformations

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 8-10 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Kinematic analysis of a humanoid robot model
- Implementation of basic walking pattern generation
- Design of manipulation trajectory for humanoid arms
- Analysis of human-robot interaction scenarios

## Resources

- Recommended readings from the course bibliography
- Links to relevant research papers and articles
- Video lectures and demonstrations (if available)

## Next Week Preview

In Week 12, we'll dive into humanoid control systems and safety protocols, exploring advanced control strategies and safety considerations for humanoid robot operation.
