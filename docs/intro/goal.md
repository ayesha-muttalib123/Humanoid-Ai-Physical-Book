# Course Goal: Develop Understanding of Physical AI

## Primary Objective

The primary goal of this course is to develop a comprehensive understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics through a structured 13-week curriculum that combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation. Students will build, program, and operate robotic systems that demonstrate key principles of embodied intelligence.

## Specific Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Understand the principles of embodied intelligence and sensorimotor integration** - Students will grasp how physical embodiment shapes intelligence and why this approach is crucial for developing general AI systems.

2. **Design and implement robotic systems with appropriate hardware and software components** - Students will learn to select and integrate appropriate hardware platforms, sensors, actuators, and software frameworks for specific robotic tasks.

3. **Apply AI algorithms to real-world physical systems with appropriate safety considerations** - Students will understand how to adapt digital AI techniques for physical systems, considering factors like safety, reliability, and environmental constraints.

4. **Integrate multiple subsystems into a functional physical AI system** - Students will gain experience combining perception, planning, control, and interaction components into cohesive robotic systems.

5. **Evaluate and improve system performance through systematic testing and analysis** - Students will develop skills in measuring system performance, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing for specific requirements.

## Course Approach

This goal is achieved through a combination of:

- **Theoretical foundations**: Understanding the principles underlying embodied intelligence
- **Practical implementation**: Hands-on experience with hardware and software tools
- **Iterative development**: Building increasingly complex systems over the 13-week period
- **Real-world applications**: Connecting concepts to actual robotics challenges
- **Safety-first mindset**: Integrating safety considerations throughout the learning process

## Capstone Achievement

The ultimate achievement of this goal is demonstrated through the capstone project, where students will develop and demonstrate a complete physical AI system that incorporates multiple learned concepts. This project showcases the integration of all the principles and techniques learned throughout the course.
