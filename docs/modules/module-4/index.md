# Module 4: Integration and Deployment

## Overview

Module 4 focuses on bringing together all components into functional Physical AI systems. This module covers the integration of hardware and software components, testing in real-world scenarios, and deployment considerations for Physical AI applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Integrate hardware and software components into cohesive systems
- Test and validate Physical AI systems in real-world environments
- Address deployment challenges for Physical AI applications
- Optimize system performance for specific deployment scenarios
- Implement safety protocols and error handling for deployed systems

## Topics Covered

This module covers the following topics:

1. [System Integration](./system-integration.md) - Combining hardware and software components
2. [Testing in Real-World Scenarios](./testing-real-world.md) - Validation and verification approaches
3. [Deployment Strategies](./deployment.md) - Practical considerations for real-world deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Completed Modules 1-3 (Foundations, Hardware Systems, and Software Frameworks)
- Experience with both hardware and software components
- Understanding of system architecture and design principles

## Estimated Time

This module requires approximately 12-15 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assessment

Module 4 includes:
- Integration project involving multiple components
- Real-world testing and validation tasks
- Deployment planning and optimization exercises
- Safety protocol implementation challenges

## Next Steps

After completing this module, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build, test, and deploy Physical AI systems. This foundation prepares them for the capstone project that synthesizes all concepts learned throughout the course.
