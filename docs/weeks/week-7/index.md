# Week 7: Simulation Environments and Testing

## Overview

Week 7 focuses on simulation environments and testing methodologies essential for developing Physical AI systems. You'll learn about various simulation platforms including Gazebo, Webots, and Isaac Sim, and explore testing strategies that ensure your robotic systems operate safely and effectively before deployment on real hardware. Simulation provides a safe, cost-effective environment for testing complex behaviors and validating control algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Configure and use different simulation environments for robotics
- Implement testing strategies for Physical AI systems
- Validate robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment
- Understand the simulation-to-reality gap and transfer techniques

## Schedule

This week consists of five chapters, each focusing on different aspects of simulation and testing:

1. [Gazebo Simulation Environment](./7-1-gazebo-simulation.md) - Physics simulation and robot modeling
2. [Webots and Alternative Platforms](./7-2-webots-alternatives.md) - Other simulation platforms and their applications
3. [Isaac Sim for NVIDIA Platforms](./7-3-isaac-sim-nvidia.md) - NVIDIA's simulation environment for robotics
4. [Testing Strategies for Physical AI](./7-4-testing-strategies.md) - Comprehensive testing approaches
5. [Week 7 Conclusion](./7-5-week-7-conclusion.md) - Summary and next steps

## Prerequisites

Before starting this week, you should have:
- Completed Week 1-6 (Introduction through Control Systems)
- Understanding of robot modeling with URDF/Xacro
- Knowledge of ROS 2 communication patterns
- Experience with control systems and motion planning

## Estimated Time

This week requires approximately 12-15 hours of study time, including reading, exercises, and practical applications.

## Assignments

- Configure a robot model in Gazebo with appropriate physics properties
- Implement a testing framework for a simple robot controller
- Compare simulation results with real-world robot behavior
- Design a simulation-to-reality transfer methodology for a specific task

## Resources

- Simulation environment documentation and tutorials
- Testing framework examples and best practices
- Physics modeling resources for robotics
- Simulation-to-reality transfer papers and techniques

## Next Week Preview

In Week 8, we'll explore AI integration in Physical AI systems, including machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing for embodied AI.
